# Egypt's Internet Problem

Despite the pace of the digital transformation & improving digital services (think instapay and others), our internet remains a source of daily frustration. Slow speeds, unstable connections, high latency, and worst of all restrictive data quotas have become part of the online experience for most Egyptians.

While almost everyone else moved toward affordable, unlimited broadband and widespread 5G coverage, Egypt’s internet is still largely constrained, both technically and structurally. Some users today are on **ultra-fast fiber connections with hard data caps no larger than 1 terabyte** which I find hilarious that you can eat up your entire data cap in just a few seconds and have to live on 256 kbps until you pay again, And **data plans that only offer a few gigabytes**. While the rest are still running VDSL/ADSL on a notoriously outdated network, causing it to be unreliable in most areas while also still being held by a data cap.

The unreliability, terrible pricing relative to average income & having to recharge multiple times a month are pushing people into anger *(just ask any WE customer service representative, they'll probably describe hell)*.

People literally have to watch videos in 360p or even worse just to avoid burning through their data cap. Forget about streaming in 4k (or even HD), Downloading games, sharing large files, these restrictions make everyday internet use a constant exercise in frustration and limitation. You’re always watching your data meter like it’s your bank account, calculating every scroll and click to avoid getting hit by the dreaded you've hit 100% of the limit notification.

It’s like having a sports car (great analogy, both unreliable) but only being allowed to drive it around at a 20km/h limit on one street only. Meanwhile, the world around us is streaming, video-calling, gaming, and working seamlessly, but in Egypt, you have to choose what you’ll sacrifice or just decide to pay more if you want to do more.

## The Digital Economy Is Growing-But Being Held Back

Egypt has a large and active tech community. Thousands of young developers, designers, and freelancers contribute to the global digital economy from home. Many of them work on platforms like Upwork, Toptal, or remote jobs with foreign companies & clients bringing **much-needed foreign currency into the country**.

But for these workers, a throttled or unstable internet connection isn’t just an annoyance, it’s a direct hit to their productivity and income. Cloud services, virtual meetings, large file transfers all depend on fast, reliable, and unrestricted access. As global standards rise and remote work becomes more competitive, Egypt’s freelancers and startups are put at a disadvantage by outdated local internet policy. It’s gotten so bad over time that some employers will outright reject hiring Egyptian nationals.

## What Should Be Done?

The biggest bottleneck isn’t just technology - it’s who controls the infrastructure. Right now, only **WE (Telecom Egypt)** is allowed to build landline infrastructure. This monopoly limits competition, innovation, and affordable expansion.

To fix Egypt’s internet problem, **private companies should be allowed and encouraged to invest in and build their own networking infrastructure**. Opening the market would drive competition, lower prices, improve service quality, and speed up fiber and 5G coverage nationwide.

The **NTRA should not control or fix pricing, even if it means we get more expensive prices**, as this stifles market dynamics and keeps prices artificially high. Instead, prices should be left to competitive forces once infrastructure competition is introduced.

Alongside this, policies must be updated to eliminate harsh data caps and throttling, allowing Egyptians access to **unlimited, affordable, and reliable internet** - because in 2025, internet access is a basic necessity, not a luxury.
